This programe calculates the Rewards points earned by customer for month as per below logic.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
